# Antihypertensive Medication Questionnaire
This is a antihypertensive medication questionnaire based on the National Healthcare Service guidelines. Further information can be found in the British National Formulary.

The purpose of this is to create a button that when clicked triggers pop ups that ask for systolic and diastolic blood pressures and age. If systolic BP >= 140 and/or diastolic BP >= 90, then you need medication. If not, then you don't. If you did need medication, age determines what medication is needed. If age >= 55, then take a calcium channel blocker (CCB) pill. If not, take an Aagiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) pill.
